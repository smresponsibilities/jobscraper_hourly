 * 23m59s, ~4.2 boards/sec — faster than the 2.6 boards/sec this constant was
 * originally sized from, because per-host scheduling (HOST_CONCURRENCY) has
 * improved since. The schedule is also no longer hourly — `hunt.yml` polls
 * every 20 minutes specifically to tolerate GitHub's flaky scheduler — so a
 * run that takes longer than 20 minutes queues behind the next trigger rather
 * than overlapping it (the concurrency block queues, never cancels). That's
 * fine against the real goal, ~1 hour data freshness, not literal 20-minute
 * delivery.
 *
 * Not every board deserves the same attention: a board that has shown an
 * India/remote role is polled every run (hot); one that never has is swept on
 * rotation, oldest-polled first (cold), and the moment one shows an India role
 * it is promoted and never rotated again — hot only grows, never shrinks.
 *
 * Raised 6,000 -> 8,000 (2026-08-18) because hot alone had reached 3,878 of
 * 6,000 slots (65%) and climbs monotonically — left unaddressed, cold rotation
 * would eventually be squeezed toward zero slots, and new boards would stop
 * getting their first chance to go hot. Verified with a real timed dry run
 * before committing, not a hunch: 8,000 boards took 26m28s (~5.0 boards/sec,
 * a further improvement over the ~4.2 boards/sec measured at 6,000 — likely
 * host-bucket parallelism paying off more as more boards spread across hosts).
 * Still comfortably inside the real goal, ~1 hour freshness, even under the
 * every-20-minute schedule's queue-not-cancel behavior. Re-measure before
 * raising again.
