 *
 * The point is to turn "12 of 15 companies in a hand-picked sample" into a real
 * hit rate over `companies.json`, since that number decides whether the contact
 * layer is worth building on or whether the paid alternative wins.
 *

 * network blip would be maddening. That file is a measurement artefact, not
 * product state — it is not committed.
