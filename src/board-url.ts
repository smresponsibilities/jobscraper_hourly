/**
 * Platforms a careers-page scan can recognise but not turn into a ready-to-add
 * `Company` on its own. `NO_ADAPTER` is "this project cannot fetch it at all";
 * `NEEDS_MANUAL_EXTRACTION` is "the adapter exists, but it needs fields (a
 * companyId hash, an org GUID, a whole hostname) that no single regex group on
 * the page can supply". `detect.ts` reports both rather than letting a real
 * board disappear into "no ATS link found".
 *
 * These live here rather than in `detect.ts` so the regression suite can hold
 * them against `FETCHERS` — importing `detect.ts` would run its `main()`.
 * That check exists because this list went stale silently: Keka and iCIMS both
 * sat in `NO_ADAPTER` long after their adapters shipped, so every Keka board a
 * scan found was reported unsupported and dropped. A YC-directory sweep on
 * 2026-09-06 hit five in one run (Peoplebox, Zuddl, Inito, Loop Health,
 * AccioJob); three held 23 live India roles between them. A platform named
 * here that has an adapter is invisible loss, not a warning.
 *
 * Keka now resolves automatically — its token is a bare subdomain, so it is in
 * `HOSTED` above. iCIMS cannot: it keeps the whole hostname as its token.

 * every entry in the catalogue, re-alerting the whole corpus on the next run.
