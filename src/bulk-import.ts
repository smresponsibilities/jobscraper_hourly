 *   npm run bulk-import -- --rediscover [--bar india|fresher|live] [--limit N]
 *   npm run bulk-import -- --file <path> [--bar india|fresher|live] [--limit N]
 *   npm run bulk-import -- --file <path> --platform X [--bar ...] [--limit N]
 *
 * `--rediscover` skips the CSV import entirely and instead walks every
 * existing Workday tenant's robots.txt for career-site names we don't already
 * track (see `discoverCandidateSites` below) — a different candidate source,
 * same validate+checkpoint pipeline.
 *
 * `--file <path>` alone is the same site-discovery step, but the tenants come
 * from a local text file of Workday hostnames (one per line, e.g.
 * `3m.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com`) instead of our own companies.json — for a
 * published hostname list, like open-jobs' `slugs.json`, that carries no site
 * at all. `--file <path> --platform X` (X other than workday) is simpler:
 * every line is a bare subdomain slug for that one ATS, no site concept to
 * resolve, straight into the validate+checkpoint loop below.
 *
 * That project crawls ~77,000 ATS tenants, ~21,000 of them on platforms this
 * codebase already reads. `detect` and `probe` cannot reach these: detect needs
 * a careers page that links its own board, and probe only guesses tokens that
 * match the brand name. A published tenant list sidesteps both.
 *
 * Every candidate is polled before it is kept, because a tenant slug that
 * resolves is not evidence of a real company — three plausible-looking "IBM"
 * Oracle tenants turned out to be a Guatemalan retailer, an Iowa college and a
 * Syracuse school district.

/**
 * Platforms whose CSV row carries everything the fetcher needs.
 *
 * Keka, Teamtailor, Breezy, Personio, Recruitee and Darwinbox joined on
 * 2026-09-06 — a platform can only be listed here if a bare slug (or a URL,
 * via `parseRow`'s fallback) is enough to build a fetchable board. Row counts
 * in that source at the time: personio 2,463, teamtailor 1,464, breezy 1,384,
 * recruitee 1,164, keka 185, darwinbox ~170.
 *
 * Recruitee and Darwinbox are the cautionary ones: both adapters had existed
 * for months while this list stayed at seven platforms, so the corpus held 37
 * Recruitee and 40 Darwinbox boards against four-figure published tenant
 * lists. Keka was the same story and one import took it from 7 boards to 170.
 * **Before adding an adapter, check whether this list is why a platform looks
 * small** — a working fetcher that nothing feeds is the same as no fetcher.
 * Darwinbox is listed with only its tenant slug on purpose: the CSV carries
 * the older `/ms/candidate/careers` URL form, which needs no companyId hash
 * (verified live against Airtel and BigBasket before adding).
 *
 * SuccessFactors (1,392 rows), Phenom (98) and Eightfold (83) joined the same
 * day, all three as hostname-token platforms. **iCIMS deliberately did not**,
 * despite having 2,498 published tenants against 2 tracked: a 12-row live
 * sample came back 0/12, every one a modern Talent Cloud portal with no
 * `/api/jobs` endpoint, which is the same wall `ADDING-COMPANIES.md` §4
 * already documents. Importing it would spend ~2,500 requests to add
 * essentially nothing. Revisit only if the modern portal's JSON-LD path gets
 * built — that is a new adapter, not a list entry.
