 *
 * First raised 50→100 on 2026-09-02 off a real local measurement (one build
 * attempted 50/50 and resolved 38/29 — both well under cap, so the cap itself
 * was the binding constraint, not a lack of real contacts; the triggered
 * lane's real pool measured 139 companies with a posting inside
 * TRIGGER_WINDOW_DAYS that day). Raised again to 500 the same day on direct
 * request — more cards to manually pick from, independent of what the
 * measured pool needs. The triggered lane still can't exceed its real
 * same-day pool regardless of this number (139 that day; it moves daily), so
 * 500 there is harmless headroom, not 500 real triggered contacts — the
 * random lane's pool is large enough that 500 there is a real target. This is
 * no longer sized off the "measure before raising" ceiling that governed the
 * first bump; if a build starts taking noticeably longer than the hourly

/**
 * One opener per kind of work, each ending in the commit's own subject.
 *
 * Two things every variant does deliberately:
 *
 *   1. It says HOW the sender found them — "going through {company}'s public
 *      repos". Unexplained knowledge of a stranger's work is the single thing
 *      that makes this kind of mail feel like surveillance; explained knowledge
 *      reads as research. It is also simply true: that is exactly what
 *      contacts.ts did to find this address.
 *   2. It reacts to the *kind* of work rather than praising the person. "Perf
 *      work is the part I like most" is a statement about the sender and cannot
 *      be wrong; "great fix!" is a judgement on code nobody here has read, and
 *      an engineer can tell the difference instantly.
 *
 * Nothing here claims to have read the diff, used the product, or understood
 * the problem. Everything that could only be known by doing so is absent on
 * purpose — the quoted subject is the whole of the evidence, and the opener
 * never pretends otherwise.
 *
 * 'revert' has no templates and never will: opening a cold email by mentioning
 * that somebody had to undo their own work is a bad first impression that no
 * phrasing rescues. It falls through to no fact at all, and buildFirstDraft
 * simply omits the paragraph.
