 * Every candidate address passes SMTP verification (verify-email.ts) before

/**
 * These three caps double as the ATTEMPT pool size, not just the output
 * ceiling — `buildBatch()` selects exactly `min(laneBudget, budget)`
 * companies per lane before resolving any contact, so a low cap starves
 * resolution of candidates rather than merely trimming a longer result.
 *
 * First raised 50→100 on 2026-09-02 off a real local measurement (one build
 * attempted 50/50 and resolved 38/29 — both well under cap, so the cap itself
 * was the binding constraint, not a lack of real contacts; the triggered
 * lane's real pool measured 139 companies with a posting inside
 * TRIGGER_WINDOW_DAYS that day). Raised again to 500 the same day on direct
 * request — more cards to manually pick from, independent of what the
 * measured pool needs. The triggered lane still can't exceed its real
 * same-day pool regardless of this number (139 that day; it moves daily), so
 * 500 there is harmless headroom, not 500 real triggered contacts — the
 * random lane's pool is large enough that 500 there is a real target. This is
 * no longer sized off the "measure before raising" ceiling that governed the
 * first bump; if a build starts taking noticeably longer than the hourly
 * cadence can absorb, that is the next thing to measure.
