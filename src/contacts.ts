 * GitHub's REST API, with no scraping and no LinkedIn involved.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-21 across fifteen Indian product companies (top three
 * most-recently-pushed repos each): twelve yielded corporate addresses. It
 * also returns the *real* mail domain rather than a guess, which matters more
 * than it sounds — swiggy.in, juspay.in and cred.club would all have been got
 * wrong by inferring a domain from the company name.
 *
 * This is a long-established OSINT technique (theHarvester, gitrecon, gitSome
 * all do it) rather than anything novel. None of those are worth taking as a
 * dependency for what fits in one file, but their existence is the evidence
 * that the approach holds up.
