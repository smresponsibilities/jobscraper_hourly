/**
 * Second published tenant source: elliottdehn/open-jobs' `slugs.json`.
 *
 *   npm run oj-slugs            # writes state/oj-<platform>.txt, one per line
 *   npm run bulk-import -- --file state/oj-breezy.txt --platform breezy
 *
 * `bulk-import.ts` already reads kalil0321/ats-scrapers. This is a genuinely
 * different corpus, not a mirror: it is derived from a Common Crawl index
 * (CC-MAIN-2026-21 at the time of writing), 64,383 unique slugs, and it is
 * fresher on the platforms the two overlap on. Measured against the corpus on
 * 2026-09-06, after the first source had already been fully imported, it still
 * held 6,783 untracked Workable slugs against the 133 Workable boards we had —
 * a platform that had been in `IMPORTABLE` the whole time. The other source
 * simply did not list them.
 *
 * Being Common-Crawl-derived is also its limitation, and worth knowing before
 * reaching for it: it only sees platforms whose board URLs leak into a web
 * crawl. It carries **no Keka, Darwinbox or Teamtailor at all** — exactly the
 * India-dense platforms — so it complements the first source rather than
 * replacing it. Check both before concluding a platform is small.
 *
 * Emitted platforms are only those where a bare slug is enough to build a
 * fetchable board. Deliberately excluded even though the file lists them:
 * Workday (needs pod + site), Eightfold (needs the tenant's mail domain as its
 * `domain=` parameter), UKG (needs a board GUID), iCIMS and SuccessFactors
 * (hostname tokens, and the file carries 137/3 of them respectively), and
 * Taleo, Dayforce, Paycom, Paylocity, Comeet, Crelate, GoHire, JobScore,
 * Pinpoint, Recruiterbox and Jobvite, none of which have an adapter here.
